# .readthedocs.yml

# For some reason, readthedocs' platform does not import the installed package (from .../envs/),
# but instead reads another copy from .../checkouts/. This other copy does not have compiled
# cython objects and throws and error.
# To overcome this issue, we had to use a custom job to install pairtools in the editable mode
# and thus ensure that the cython code is compiled.
# Another potentially useful trick in the future: setting environmental variables 
# (e.g. PIP_VERBOSE and PIP_NO_BUILD_ISOLATION=false) can control pip's behaviour in
# the standard install job.
